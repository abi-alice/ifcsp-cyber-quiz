# Cyber Security Awareness Quiz Application
Welcome to the Cyber Quiz App repository! 
This simple tkinter GUI-based application using Python 3.11 will test users on their basic cyber security knowledge, and stores their name and result in a CSV file. My organisation is constructing a nuclear power station, so all employees must have basic cyber security awareness.
This is vital as without it, the risk of classified information being leaked is at a much greater risk, and a data breach could put millions of people in danger.
There is a large variety of teams with specific functions throughout the organisation, including many external contractors. However all teams handle organisational data in some way, and as construction progresses, the sensitivity of the data will only increase.
It is best to ensure cyber security principles are well ingrained among the workforce so that good habits are built and risk from lack of knowledge stays as low as possible.
